                <h2 class="lb-heading">Monkey D. Luffy - The Captain</h2>
                <p class="lb-text">Monkey D. Luffy is the carefree but determined founder and captain of the Straw Hat Pirates.
                <br>
                <br>
                After eating the Gum-Gum Fruit, Luffy gained the power to stretch his body like rubber. Known as “Straw Hat Luffy” or “Straw Hat”, his ultimate dream is to find the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger, the One Piece, and to become the new Pirate King. He believes being Pirate King is having the most freedom in the world. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Though he often acts goofy and impulsive, Luffy’s pure heart, unshakable will, and loyalty to his crew inspire everyone around him.

                <h2 class="lb-heading">Roronoa Zoro - The Swordsman</h2>
                <p class="lb-text">Roronoa Zoro, also known as “Pirate Hunter Zoro,” is the crew’s swordsman and Luffy’s first crewmate. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was a former bounty hunter before joining Luffy’s crew. He is recognized by his unique Three-Sword Style, wielding a blade in each hand and one in his mouth. His dream is to become the world’s greatest swordsman, fulfilling a promise to a lost friend. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As one of the crew's strongest members, Zoro is stoic, disciplined, and endlessly determined. He is the crew’s rock—though his sense of direction is notoriously terrible.

                <h2 class="lb-heading">Nami - The Navigator</h2>
                <p class="lb-text">Nami, also known as “Cat Burglar Nami,” is The Straw Hats’ skilled navigator and cartographer. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once a thief who stole from pirates, Nami joined Luffy’s crew after he freed her from Arlong's (A Villainous Fishman’s) control. Using her cartography skills and her “Clima-Tact” weapon, which allows her to manipulate the weather, she fights her way through The Grand Line to achieve her dream of creating a complete map of the entire world. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Nami is clever, confident, and occasionally greedy; she balances the crew’s chaos with her practicality and sharp mind.

                <p class="lb-text">Usopp, known as “God Usopp” or “Sogeking”, is the crew’s sharpshooter, storyteller, and inventor.
                <br>
                <br>
                 He dreams of becoming a “brave warrior of the sea” like his father, Yasopp. Though he is known for his elaborate tales and cowardice, Usopp shows great bravery when it counts. In battle, though he isn’t the strongest fighter, he uses his slingshot to aid his fellow crewmates. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 He is a creative genius with his gadgets and slingshot. Usopp’s courage and heart make him an irreplaceable Straw Hat.

                <p class="lb-text">Sanji, known as “Black Leg Sanji,” is The Straw Hats’ cook.
                <br>
                <br>
                 He is one of the crew's strongest members, fighting only with his powerful legs to keep his hands clean for cooking. Born as Vinsmoke Sanji, a former prince of the Germa Kingdom, he is disowned by his family and raised on the Baratie restaurant ship by the head chef and former pirate, Jeff. Sanji dreams of finding the All Blue, a legendary sea where every fish in the world gathers. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Sanji is a hopeless romantic around women, a fierce fighter against injustice, and a master of both cuisine and combat.
